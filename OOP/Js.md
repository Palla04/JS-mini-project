# Does JavaScript really have classes?
  Yes, JavaScript does have classes. They were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to provide a simpler and more intuitive syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance. Although JavaScript has always been a prototype-based language, classes offer a more traditional object-oriented approach, making it easier for developers familiar with other object-oriented languages to work with JavaScript.

### this
In JavaScript, the keyword this is used to refer to the current context, which in the case of an object method, refers to the object itself. When you use this inside a method, it allows you to access the properties and other methods of the object that the method belongs to.
